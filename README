This program plays a game of bowling. Has single and multiplayer options.



--Thoughts--
This is a program i wrote because a friend of mine mentioned it. They were doing
it in python, i thought it sounded fun so i did it aswell.


The way i organized the headers is not something i would probably do all the time.
It seperates the different parts of the functionalities. I wrote this just out of
doing C++ object things, and was playing around with different ways to organize
my code.

I am not a huge fan of how many files and extra functions there are to format
things this way tho. Seemed like a hassling experience sometimes, where more
straight to the point options were available. Not sure how much readability this
does since theres so many headers, not all with much code.
